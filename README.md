# Boardoverse - Solana PvP Game Contract

A decentralized player-vs-player (PvP) game contract built on Solana using the Anchor framework. This smart contract facilitates secure escrow-based gaming where two players can compete with an authorized arbiter determining the winner.

## üéÆ Overview

Boardoverse enables trustless PvP gaming by:
- Holding player funds in escrow during gameplay
- Using an authorized arbiter to determine winners
- Ensuring fair fund distribution or refunds
- Providing dispute resolution mechanisms

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Game States
- **WaitingForPlayer2**: Game created, waiting for second player to join
- **InProgress**: Both players joined, game is active
- **Finished**: Game completed with declared winner
- **Cancelled**: Game stopped by arbiter with refunds

### Key Components
- **Players**: Two participants who stake funds
- **Arbiter**: Trusted third party who declares winners or cancels games
- **Game Account**: PDA that holds escrowed funds and game state
